 # Demoing how to solve merge conflicts
 ## Getting Started

- Fork this repository under your own account
- Make two pull requests from the branches (BRANCH-1 and BRANCH-2) to master
- Solve the merge conflict
- If you were only practicing, delete the forked repository after, so you can fork it once more for the exam
